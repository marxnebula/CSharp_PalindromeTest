# CSharp_PalindromeTest
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.

DESCRIPTION: In this program I use an index, i, that starts on the first letter of the string, and a second index, j, that starts on the last letter of the string.  I check to see if these values are the same.  If they are not the same then return false because it is no longer a palindrome.  If they are the same then I add 1 to i, and subtract 1 from j.  Repeat until done. I ignore spaces and set the string to lowercase.
